      <strong>Quote:</strong> What has to be done is to shun policies that like credit expansion artificially foster malinvestment.<br>
      <strong>Book:</strong> Human Action<br>
      <strong>Page Number:</strong> p. 394; pp. 392
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Quote:</strong> The notion of 'normal' credit expansion is absurd. Issuance of additional fiduciary media, no matter what its quantity may be, always sets in motion those changes in the price structure the description of which is the task of the theory of the trade cycle.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> The inference to be drawn from the monetary cycle theory by those who want to prevent the recurrence of booms and of the subsequent depressions is that they should abstain from credit expansion.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> It is clear that prohibition of fiduciary media would by no means imply a death sentence for the banking system, as is sometimes asserted. The banks would still retain the business of negotiating credit, of borrowing for the purpose of lending.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> [Under 100% reserve banking,] it would no longer be possible for the credit-issuing banks to underbid the equilibrium rate of interest and introduce into circulation new quantities of fiduciary media with the immediate consequence of an artificial stimulus to business and the inevitable final consequence of the dreaded economic crisis.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> The basic conception of Peel's Act ought to be restated and more completely implemented than it was in the England of his time by including the issue of credit in the form of bank balances within the legislative prohibition.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> The main thing is that the government should no longer be in a position to increase the quantity of money in circulation and the amount of checkbook money not fully — that is, 100 percent-covered by deposits paid in by the public. No backdoor must be left open where inflation can slip in.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> If one wants to avoid the recurrence of economic crises, one must avoid the expansion of credit that creates the boom and inevitably leads into the slump.<br>

      <strong>Page Number:</strong> p. 482

      <strong>Quote:</strong> The first step must be a radical and unconditional abandonment of any further inflation. The total amount of dollar bills, whatever their name or legal characteristic may be, must not be increased by further issuance. No bank must be permitted to expand the total amount of its deposits subject to check or the balance of such deposits of any individual customer, be he a private citizen or the U.S. Treasury, otherwise than by receiving cash deposits in legal-tender banknotes from the public or by receiving a check payable by another domestic bank subject to the same limitations. This means a rigid 100 percent reserve for all future deposits; that is, all deposits not already in existence on the first day of the reform.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> The surest means to achieve a cycle-proof economic system lies in preventing credit expansion.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> I [am] convinced of the indefensibility of the doctrine of 'elasticity' of bank credit.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> There is only one means to avoid the return of periods of economic depression, viz., to abstain from any attempts to produce by credit expansion a passing artificial boom.<br>
      <strong>Book:</strong> Economic Freedom and Interventionism<br>
      <strong>Page Number:</strong> p. 273

      <strong>Quote:</strong> The bedrock and cornerstone of the provisional new monetary system must be the absolute prohibition of the issue of any additional notes not completely covered by gold. There must be absolutely no expansion above this maximum under any circumstances.<br>
      <strong>Book:</strong> On the Manipulation of Money and Credit<br>
      <strong>Page Number:</strong> p. 39

      <strong>Quote:</strong> What is needed now is only to prohibit the issue of additional notes not covered by gold.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> [My proposal] means the introduction of a new program based on the old Currency School theory, but expanded in the light of the present state of knowledge to include fiduciary media issued in the form of bank deposits. The banks would be obliged at all times to maintain metallic backing for all notes—except for the sum of those outstanding which are not now covered by metal—equal to the total sum of the notes issued and bank deposits opened. That would mean a complete reorganization of central bank legislation. The banks of issue would have to return to the principles of Peel's Bank Act, but with the provisions expanded to cover also bank balances subject to check. By this act alone, cyclical policy would be directed in earnest toward the elimination of crises.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> There is a serious danger for the future of the individualistic organization of the economy in the development of fiduciary media; if the legislature does not put some obstacle in the way of its expansion, an unrestrained inflation could easily come about, the destructive effects of which cannot really be imagined. Even if we ignore this, as yet, not immediate threat, there is sufficient risk from the very nature of the system of fiduciary media. It would be desirable to put an end to the artificial expansion of fiduciary media. It would not only slow down the rate of devaluation, but it would also be the best way of preventing economic crises.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> Reform has to consist of the adoption of a rigid 100 percent reserve plan.<br>

      <strong>Page Number:</strong> p. 105

    <li>
      <strong>Quote:</strong> What the 100 percent reserve scheme aims at is the prevention of credit expansion. What is needed is the elimination of the business cycle. Not stability of prices, but stability of the trend of business is desirable.<br>
      <strong>Book:</strong> Selected Writings v. 3<br>
      <strong>Page Number:</strong> p. 107
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Quote:</strong> If future credit expansion is to be avoided, it is necessary to apply the one hundred percent reserve principle also to bank deposits. Only the acceptance of a rigid principle will prevent an unprecedented credit expansion and its unavoidable outcome, a slump.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> He who wants to prevent the recurrence of economic crises must prevent the resumption of credit expansion.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> To eliminate the depression the preceding boom must be prevented.<br>

      <strong>Quote:</strong> Credit expansion cannot increase the supply of real goods. It merely brings about a rearrangement. It diverts capital investment from the course prescribed by the state of economic wealth and market conditions. It causes production to pursue paths which it would not follow unless the economy were to acquire an increase in material goods.<br>
